When contributing to quotes, we please ask that you :
- let us know what you plan in the GitHub Issue tracker so we can provide feedback
- provide tests and documentation if possible. New functionalitys will be much easier be added if tested and documented. If fixing a bug, provide a failing test case that your patch solves.
- Finaly, open a GitHub Pull Request with your patches and we will review your contribution and respond as quickly as possible. Keep in mind this is an open source project, and it may takes us some time to get back to you. Your patiente is much appreciated.
